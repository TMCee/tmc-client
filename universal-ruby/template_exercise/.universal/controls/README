This folder contains three scripts: run, test and get-points. Those are the scripts that are used to run the project, run the project's tests that produce a JSON output (form of the output seen on the repository root README), and produce an output showing which tests provide which points. No other content should be needed here, unless the creator of the project sees fit to add more scripts invoked by these three.
